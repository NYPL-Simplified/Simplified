# Library Simplified

This is the meta-repository for the Library Simplified project. It contains big-picture issues that cross repository boundaries, the project's wiki, and related documents.


## The Library Simplified Project

With the help of the [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/), ten public libraries across the United States are partnering up to re-think traditional library policies and building new technology to make the libraries and their digital collections easier to access. Our goal is to break down barriers to library use so that more people take advantage of all the services that the library offers. We hope youâ€™ll join the conversation. **If you'd like to know more about Library Simplified, please [visit our website](http://www.librarysimplified.org/).**


## Our Code

Library Simplified is a collection of middleware, server software and mobile client applications for iOS and Android that libraries may use to deliver digital content to their patrons for experimentation or daily eBook services. It is designed to provide a unique user experience for the lending of eBooks and other digital content. It is intended to work and integrate with technologies and systems common to libraries such as an Integrated Library System/Library Management Systems (ILS/LMS), Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) or Single Sign On (SSO) credential management system or commercial eBook hosting and distribution service such as Overdrive, Baker & Taylor's Access 360, or 3M Cloud Library.
