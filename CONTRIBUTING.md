# Contributing to Library Simplified

## Reporting Bugs and Issues

Bugs are inevitable, and we're committed to fixing them as soon as possible.

Before you report a bug or issue, please confirm that it hasn't already been reported by reviewing the issues in the relevant repository. If it has, let's combine our efforts! Add a comment about your specific case, including the details in Step 2 below.

Otherwise:

1. In the proper repository, create a new issue with a clear and precise title.
2. Include *as much detail as possible* in the issue description, e.g.:
    - the entire error message
    - what you were trying to do when the error occurred
    - which page the error occurred on
    - what link(s) or button(s) you clicked to get to the error
    - which book, author, format, etc. the bug involves
    - your platform or OS
    - screenshots or screencasts are extremely helpful!
3. Tag it with the label "bug".

If we can't recreate your error, we won't be able fix it, so we appreciate any and all specifics you can share.

## Contributing Code

### Expansion

Is your library working on a new interface, widget, feature, or expansion package for an existing Library Simplified project? [Email us](info@librarysimplified.org) to let us know how it supports the Library Simplified ecosystem and ask us any development questions.

### Getting Started

There are lots of ways to get involved with Library Simplified. Before you start, take a look at our current priorities

1. Review our [Product Backlog](http://www.librarysimplified.org/productbacklog.html).
2. Check out our [roadmap issues](https://github.com/nypl-simplified/simplified/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroadmap+) and [overall goals](https://github.com/nypl-simplified/simplified/milestones).
3. Take a look at the issues in the specific Library Simplified repository that you're interested in working on.
4. Watch [our Waffle board](https://waffle.io/nypl-simplified/simplified) to see what we're working on now and review unassigned issues in our backlog.
5. **Let us know what you're going to work on -- *before* you spend a lot of time on it.** Assign an issue to yourself on GitHub and/or reach out via email: info@librarysimplified.org.

### Installation

Review the [Deployment Instructions](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified-iOS/wiki/Deployment-Instructions) in the wiki and look to the README of the relevant repository.

### Workflow

1. Assign yourself to an issue. Give it the "ready" or "in progress" label.
2. Fork the relevant repository to your own GitHub account.
3. `git clone` the repository to your computer and perform the relevant installation steps.
4. Create an appropriately-named `git branch` off of master to hold your work.
5. Write code to fix the issue and tests to support the code. Commit at sensible intervals.
6. Submit your finished code back to the Library Simplified repo via pull request.
    - Use the pull request description to detail the changes you've made, the reasoning behind them, and any follow-up issues that might be necessary.
    - Add "Closes #YOUR_ISSUE_NUMBER" to the PR description to link the issue in GitHub and Waffle.
7. Replace the "ready" or "in progress" label with the "in review" label, lean back, and feel good about yourself and your life decisions. We'll get back to you with any feedback as soon as we can.
